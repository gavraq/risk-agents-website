# Task 05: Hero Section Redesign

## Objective
Replace complex AIMM diagram with simple, powerful hero message.

## Current State
- AIMM Diagram (complex, technical, buried lead)
- Too much information immediately

## New Hero Structure
```
[Dark background with logo imagery/space theme]

"AI Augments. Humans Decide."

[Subheadline: Expanding the boundaries of your vision]

"Risk Intelligence for Banks & Financial Institutions"

[CTA: Request Early Access] [CTA: See How It Works]
```

## Tasks

- [x] Remove AIMM diagram from homepage hero
- [x] Create new hero section with dark theme
- [x] Add main headline: "AI Augments. Humans Decide."
- [x] Add subheadline incorporating strapline
- [x] Add audience identifier: "for Banks & Financial Institutions"
- [x] Style CTAs with subtle hover effects
- [x] Ensure generous negative space
- [x] Make fully responsive

## Implementation Notes (2026-01-13)
- Removed complex AIMM diagram (5-level maturity model visualization)
- Created clean, minimal hero with large typography and generous whitespace
- Responsive text sizes: 4xl→5xl→6xl→7xl for main headline
- CTAs use existing btn-primary/btn-secondary classes with subtle hover effects
- "See How It Works" links to #learn-more section (Three Innovations)
- Hero uses existing dark theme CSS variables (text-secondary, text-muted)

## Key Principles
- Lead with HUMAN message, not AI message
- Allure and intrigue, don't explain everything
- 5-second test: visitor understands value immediately
